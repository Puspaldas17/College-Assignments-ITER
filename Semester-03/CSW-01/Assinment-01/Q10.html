    <h1><b><em>S = <i>vᵢ</i>t + ½<i>a</i>t²: The Equation of Linear Motion</em></b></h1>
    <p>
      The formula <i>S</i> = <i>vᵢ</i>t + ½<i>a</i>t² describes the motion of an object under constant acceleration. 
      As Sir Isaac Newton once said, "An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an <u>external force</u>." 
      This fundamental principle underlies the equation, which accurately predicts the displacement of objects.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>S</i> represents the displacement.</li>
      <li><i>vᵢ</i> is the initial velocity.</li>
      <li><i>t</i> is the time.</li>
      <li><i>a</i> is the acceleration.</li>
      <li>½<i>at</i>² is the additional displacement due to acceleration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: This equation was originally formulated in the context of classical mechanics and has been widely used since its introduction.</p>
